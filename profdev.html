        <h1>Professional Development</h1>
        <p>The UPE Professional Development committee offers a variety of services to help students prepare for the workforce, ranging from <a href="#resumes">resume critiques</a> and <a class="anchor-link" href="#interviews">mock technical interviews</a> to public workshops covering various stages of the recruiting process and beyond. </p>
        <h2><a class="anchor-link" name="interviews"></a>Technical Interviews</h2>
        <p>Interviews for Software Enginee (SWE) positions often include a technical portion, where candidates are expected to solve a coding or design. These can range from solving by hand on a whiteboard to solving with an IDE.</p>
        <p>To prepare for a technical interview, we suggest reading and working through books such as <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms">Introduction to Algorithms</a> (commonly referred to as CLRS), <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap0.pdf">Algorithms</a>, <a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">Cracking the Coding Interview</a>, and <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> (all of which are available through <a href="office.html">UPE’s Library</a>!); practicing coding problems on sites like <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a>; and practicing whiteboarding problems under interview conditions. Some general tips include: 
            <ul>
                <li>Talk to your interviewer - this includes asking clarifying questions and explaining your thought process.</li>
                <li>Be very comfortable with whichever programming language you decide to use (we suggest Python, since it’s fairly concise and easy to read). Companies vary on how strict they are with getting the exact syntax correct from memory, but regardless, being comfortable with the language allows you to spend more time thinking about the problem and not syntax.</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>The UPE Professional Development committee offers mock technical interviews a member of UPE's Professional Development committee will give you a coding problem to work out on the board or on a shared Google doc. You will work through through the problem, and at the end will receive feedback on how you can do better next time
        </p>
        <p>To sign up for a mock interview, book a slot on the calendar below <b>at least 24 hours before the appointment time</b>. Once you book a slot, the interviewer will confirm within 24 hours that they are still available for that time. <b>You are not confirmed for the appointment until you receive that email</b>. The appointment description will say who the interviewr is and whether the interview will be in person or online. Please be considerate of other students and book no more that one mock interview every two weeks.</p>

        <h2><a name="resumes"></a> Resume Critiques</h2>
        <p>To receive a personalized resume critique, drop by the office (346 Soda) during office hours (M-F 10AM - 4PM), or send your resume to <a href="mailto:profdev@upe.berkeley.edu">profdev@upe.berkeley.edu</a> with the title “[UPE] Resume Critique Request”.</p>
        <p>Some general tips include:</p>
        <h4>Style</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure your resume is grammatically correct (and free of typos) and consistent (past vs. present tense, complete sentences vs. fragments).</li>
            <li>Keep the design legible, with large enough font size and enough whitespace, and clean.</li>
            <li>Have some hierarchical organization. Make sure your name is large and your contact information is easy to find. Separate sections with headers.</li>
            <li>Unless you have many, many amazing publications, keep your resume to exactly one page, and try to fill up the whole page. If you have trouble filling up the whole page, read on for tips on content.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Content</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Definitely include sections for contact information, education, and past work experience. Optionally include sections for personal projects, research, achievements, activities, and relevant coursework (roughly ordered from most to least important).</li>
            <li>Unless you are a freshman, only list experience, achievements, and activites you started or continued in college.</li>
            <li>Put information most relevant to the position you are applying for. This applies to relevant coursework and past work experience.</li>
            <li>Make sure to include your specific contributions, not just general descriptions of your position.</li>
        </ul>
